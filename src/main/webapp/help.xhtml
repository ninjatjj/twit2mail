	<p>The app asks you to login using twitter (so I don't see your password etc). Then it asks for your email address to send you notifications. It asks for your youtube username (optional) to add your subscriptions as feeds.</p> 
	<p>Once that is done the system would be configured to email you daily at 7am with your twitter updates and youtube updates (if applicable). You can also add your own rss feeds.</p>
	<p>When adding a feed the order of the fields is: name, include the content in the feed (and therefore don't digest), feed url</p>
	<p>You then have the option of adding any of these feeds to a variety of "circles". </p>
	<p>You can create your own circles and circles can be in circles, for example I have:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>newsgaming=_news_,_gaming_</li>
	</ul>
	<p>When adding a circle the order of the fields is: name, update frequency (cron), feed list</p>
